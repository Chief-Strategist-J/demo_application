# Firebase Issues Fixed

This document outlines all the Firebase-related issues that were identified and resolved in the demo application.

## Issues Addressed

### 1. Firebase Firestore NOT_FOUND Error

**Issue**: 
```
W/Firestore(19266): (25.1.4) [WriteStream]: (d37156f) Stream closed with status: Status{code=NOT_FOUND, description=No document to update: projects/call-de/databases/(default)/documents/users/lCYNsu0PGBcWw14JgMn1KApD2X13, cause=null}.
I/flutter (19266): Error updating online status: [cloud_firestore/not-found] Some requested document was not found.
```

**Root Cause**: The application was using Firestore's `update()` method on documents that might not exist yet, causing NOT_FOUND errors.

**Solution**: 
- Replaced all `update()` calls with `set()` calls using `SetOptions(merge: true)`
- This ensures documents are created if they don't exist, or updated if they do
- Created a `FirebaseUtils` helper class for consistent document handling

### 2. OnBackInvokedCallback Warning

**Issue**: 
```
W/OnBackInvokedCallback(19266): OnBackInvokedCallback is not enabled for the application.
W/OnBackInvokedCallback(19266): Set 'android:enableOnBackInvokedCallback="true"' in the application manifest.
```

**Solution**: Added `android:enableOnBackInvokedCallback="true"` to the Android manifest file.

### 3. Flutter Engine Plugin Registration Warnings

**Issue**: 
```
W/FlutterEngineCxnRegstry(21765): Attempted to register plugin (gx.b@96d5beb) but it was already registered with this FlutterEngine (io.flutter.embedding.engine.a@853ed48).
```

**Note**: This warning is typically harmless and occurs during hot reloads or plugin re-registrations. It should not occur in production builds.

## Files Modified

### 1. `lib/services/auth_service.dart`
- Updated `updateOnlineStatus()` to use `set()` with merge instead of `update()`
- Updated `signOut()` to use `set()` with merge instead of `update()`
- Updated `signInWithGoogle()` to use retry mechanism for better reliability
- Added import for `FirebaseUtils`

### 2. `lib/services/firebase_service.dart`
- Updated `acceptCall()` to use `set()` with merge instead of `update()`
- Updated `declineCall()` to use batch operations with safe document handling
- Updated `endCall()` to use batch operations with safe document handling
- Updated `initiateCall()` to use batch operations for better performance
- Updated `getCallRequest()` to use safe document retrieval
- Added import for `FirebaseUtils`

### 3. `lib/services/firebase_utils.dart` (New File)
Created a comprehensive utility class with the following methods:
- `safeDocumentUpdate()`: Safely updates documents with merge option
- `safeDocumentGet()`: Safely retrieves documents with null handling
- `safeBatchUpdate()`: Performs batch operations with error handling
- `documentExists()`: Checks document existence without throwing errors
- `createDocumentWithRetry()`: Creates documents with retry mechanism and exponential backoff

### 4. `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`
- Added `android:enableOnBackInvokedCallback="true"` attribute to the application tag

## Key Improvements

### 1. Better Error Handling
- All Firebase operations now handle document non-existence gracefully
- Added retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
- Improved error logging and debugging information

### 2. Performance Optimizations
- Replaced multiple individual `update()` calls with batch operations
- Reduced the number of round trips to Firestore
- More efficient document creation and updates

### 3. Code Reliability
- Eliminated race conditions in document creation/updates
- Added proper null checks and safe document retrieval
- Consistent error handling across all Firebase operations

### 4. Developer Experience
- Better error messages and logging
- Centralized Firebase utilities for reusability
- Cleaner and more maintainable code structure

## Testing Recommendations

1. **User Authentication Flow**: Test Google sign-in to ensure user documents are created properly
2. **Online Status Updates**: Verify that user online/offline status updates work without errors
3. **Call Operations**: Test call initiation, acceptance, decline, and ending operations
4. **Edge Cases**: Test operations when documents don't exist or network is unreliable
5. **Background/Foreground**: Test app lifecycle changes to ensure presence system works correctly

## Future Considerations

1. **FCM Integration**: The current implementation simulates push notifications. Consider implementing proper FCM for production
2. **Security Rules**: Ensure Firestore security rules are properly configured for the new document structure
3. **Monitoring**: Add proper error tracking and analytics for production monitoring
4. **Offline Support**: Consider implementing offline capabilities for better user experience

## Summary

All identified Firebase issues have been resolved:
- ✅ NOT_FOUND errors eliminated by using merge operations
- ✅ OnBackInvokedCallback warning fixed
- ✅ Better error handling and retry mechanisms implemented
- ✅ Performance improvements through batch operations
- ✅ Code maintainability improved with utility classes

The application should now run without Firebase-related errors and provide a more robust user experience.
